# Plan 007 — Online Multiplayer

## Decisions (do not re-debate these)
- **Backend:** Firebase (managed, no server to maintain)
- **Web frontend:** React, hosted on Firebase Hosting
- **Players:** Android app + web browser can play together in the same game
- **Matchmaking:** both room codes (friends) and random public matching
- **Auth:** Google Sign-In for registered users + Guest mode
- **Platform badges:** show Android/browser icon next to player name (easy, keep it)
- **Watch mode:** share the game URL → opens as spectator if all player slots taken
- **Game history:** deferred to a later plan

## Architecture

```
[ Android App ]          [ Web Browser (React) ]
      |                            |
      +-------- Firebase SDK ------+
                    |
     [ Firestore — game rooms & moves ]
     [ Firebase Auth — Google Sign-In ]
     [ Cloud Functions — matchmaking  ]
     [ Firebase Hosting — React app   ]
```

### Game room document (Firestore)
```json
{
  "roomCode": "XK92P",
  "status": "waiting | in_progress | finished",
  "players": [
    { "uid": "abc", "name": "Mahmud", "platform": "android", "color": "RED" }
  ],
  "spectators": ["uid1", "uid2"],
  "moves": [
    { "playerUid": "abc", "diceRoll": 4, "pawnId": "R1", "timestamp": 1234 }
  ],
  "currentTurn": "abc",
  "winner": null,
  "createdAt": timestamp,
  "updatedAt": timestamp
}
```

Both Android and web clients listen to this document in real time.
A move = append to `moves[]`. All clients apply moves to their local deterministic GameEngine.

### User profile document (Firestore)
```json
{
  "uid": "abc",
  "name": "Mahmud",
  "platform": "android",
  "isGuest": false,
  "createdAt": timestamp
}
```

### Guest vs Registered
| Feature | Guest | Registered |
|---|---|---|
| Play | Yes | Yes |
| Watch | Yes | Yes |
| Room codes | Yes | Yes |
| Random matchmaking | Yes | Yes |
| Username | Auto (Guest#4821) | Chosen / Google display name |
| Game history | Lost on session end | Saved (future plan) |
| Reconnect interrupted game | No | Yes |
| Stats / leaderboard | No | Yes (future) |

## Phase 1 — Firebase project setup
- [ ] Create Firebase project at console.firebase.google.com
- [ ] Enable Firestore database (start in test mode)
- [ ] Enable Firebase Auth → turn on Google Sign-In provider
- [ ] Enable Anonymous Auth (for guest mode)
- [ ] Register Android app in Firebase console → download `google-services.json`
- [ ] Place `google-services.json` in `app/`
- [ ] Add `google-services` plugin to `app/build.gradle.kts`
- [ ] Add Firebase BOM + Firestore + Auth dependencies to `app/build.gradle.kts`
- [ ] Verify app builds with Firebase dependencies

---

## Phase 2 — Android authentication
- [ ] Create `AuthRepository.kt` — wraps Firebase Auth (sign in with Google, sign in as guest, sign out, get current user)
- [ ] Create `UserProfileRepository.kt` — reads/writes user profile document in Firestore
- [ ] On first launch: show auth screen with "Continue with Google" and "Play as Guest"
- [ ] Guest sign-in: Firebase Anonymous Auth → auto-generate username `Guest#XXXX` → write profile doc
- [ ] Google sign-in: use GoogleSignIn + Firebase credential → write profile doc
- [ ] After auth: navigate to HomeScreen (existing)
- [ ] Show current username somewhere on HomeScreen
- [ ] "Sign in" nudge shown to guests (dismissible)

---

## Phase 3 — Android lobby screen
- [ ] Add "Play Online" button to HomeScreen → navigates to OnlineLobbyScreen
- [ ] Create `OnlineLobbyScreen.kt` with three options: Create Room / Join Room / Find Match
- [ ] **Create Room flow:**
  - [ ] Generate 6-char alphanumeric room code (client-side, check uniqueness in Firestore)
  - [ ] Write new game room document to Firestore
  - [ ] Navigate to WaitingRoomScreen showing the code + waiting for opponent
- [ ] **Join Room flow:**
  - [ ] Text field for room code entry
  - [ ] Look up room in Firestore → validate it exists and has an open slot
  - [ ] Add self to `players[]` in the room document
  - [ ] Navigate to WaitingRoomScreen
- [ ] **WaitingRoomScreen:**
  - [ ] Show room code prominently with a share button
  - [ ] Show connected players with platform badges
  - [ ] Listen to room document — when `status` changes to `in_progress`, navigate to game
  - [ ] Host can tap "Start Game" (minimum 2 players)
- [ ] Starting game: host sets `status = in_progress`, assigns colors to players

---

## Phase 4 — Android game sync (network layer)
- [ ] Create `OnlineGameRepository.kt` — listens to moves subcollection, writes moves
- [ ] Create `OnlineGameViewModel.kt` — bridges OnlineGameRepository with existing GameEngine
- [ ] Key design: GameEngine stays pure/local. ViewModel feeds opponent moves into it when Firestore listener fires.
- [ ] Local player move flow: player taps pawn → ViewModel validates turn is theirs → writes move to Firestore → does NOT apply locally yet → waits for Firestore confirmation → applies move
- [ ] Opponent move flow: Firestore listener fires with new move → ViewModel applies it to GameEngine → UI updates
- [ ] This ensures both clients always see the same sequence of moves
- [ ] Create `OnlineGameBoardScreen.kt` (wraps existing GameBoardScreen or reuses it via a flag)
- [ ] Show opponent names + platform badges on the board
- [ ] Disable controls when it is not the local player's turn
- [ ] Handle game end: when `winner` is set in Firestore → show WinScreen
- [ ] Handle disconnect: if a player's connection drops for >60s, mark them as disconnected in the room doc

---

## Phase 5 — React web app
- [x] Bootstrap: Vite + React + TypeScript (`ludo-web/`)
- [x] Add Firebase Web SDK: `npm install firebase`
- [ ] Register web app in Firebase console → get `appId` → add to `ludo-web/.env.local`
- [x] Create `firebase.ts` — initialize app, export `db` (Firestore) and `auth`
- [x] **Auth screens** (mirrors Android Phase 2):
  - [x] Google Sign-In button
  - [x] "Play as Guest" button
  - [x] Same anonymous auth + profile write logic
- [x] **Lobby screen** (mirrors Android Phase 3):
  - [x] Create Room / Join Room buttons
  - [x] WaitingRoom component with share link (copies spectator game URL)
- [x] **Game board** (new, no existing code to reuse):
  - [x] Draw board on SVG
  - [x] Replicate board layout: 15×15 grid, safe squares, home columns, center
  - [x] Pawn components with platform badges
  - [x] Firestore listener drives board state (same move-relay logic as Android)
  - [x] Disable controls when not local player's turn
- [x] **Spectator mode:**
  - [x] If user is not in room when opening game URL → set `isSpectator = true`
  - [x] `?spectate=1` query param also forces spectator mode (for share links)
  - [x] Spectators see the board updating but have no controls
  - [ ] Show spectator count on screen (deferred)
- [ ] Deploy to Firebase Hosting: `npx firebase-tools deploy --only hosting` (needs `firebase login` first)
- [ ] Connect custom domain in Firebase Hosting console

---

## Phase 6 — Random matchmaking (Cloud Function)
- [ ] Set up Firebase CLI: `npm install -g firebase-tools` → `firebase init functions`
- [ ] Write `matchmakingQueue` Cloud Function (Node.js/TypeScript):
  - [ ] Triggered when a document is written to `/matchmaking_queue/{uid}`
  - [ ] Queue doc: `{ uid, name, platform, timestamp, playerCount: 2|4 }`
  - [ ] Function checks queue for enough players of same `playerCount`
  - [ ] When match found: create game room, write room ID back to each queued player's doc, delete queue entries
- [ ] Android "Find Match" flow:
  - [ ] Write self to queue → listen to own queue doc for `matchedRoomId` field → navigate to WaitingRoom
  - [ ] Cancel button: delete own queue doc
- [ ] Web "Find Match" flow: same logic
- [ ] Timeout: if in queue >2 min with no match, show "No opponents found, try again"
- [ ] Deploy function: `firebase deploy --only functions`

---

## Phase 7 — Watch mode polish
- [ ] Every game screen shows a "Share" button → copies `yourdomain.com/game/{gameId}` to clipboard
- [ ] On Android: share intent (WhatsApp, SMS, etc.)
- [ ] Deep link on Android: opening the URL when app is installed → opens game in app as spectator
- [ ] Web: direct URL works already (from Phase 5)
- [ ] Show live spectator count in-game
- [ ] Spectator chat (optional, defer if complex)

---

## Phase 8 — Game history (deferred)
- See plan 005 for history notation work already done.
- Online game history will be covered in a future plan once Phases 1–7 are stable.

---

## Verification checkpoints
- After Phase 1: app builds and connects to Firebase without crash
- After Phase 2: can sign in as guest or Google, profile appears in Firestore console
- After Phase 3: two Android devices can join the same room by code, see each other in waiting room
- After Phase 4: full game plays end-to-end between two Android devices, moves sync correctly
- After Phase 5: Android player and browser player can play a full game together
- After Phase 6: two devices both tap "Find Match" and get paired automatically
- After Phase 7: opening the share link in a browser shows the live game as spectator
